# DevOps/SRE Portfolio - Satyam Priyam

## 👋 Overview
This repository contains work samples demonstrating operational excellence, observability design, and incident management from my DevSecOps pipeline implementations.

**Core Technologies:** Kubernetes | GitHub Actions | New Relic | Terraform | Azure | NRQL | SonarQube | Trivy

## 📋 Work Samples

### 1. [Deployment Alert Runbook](./samples/01-runbook-deployment-alert.md)
**Demonstrates:** Incident response, troubleshooting workflows, kubectl operations, New Relic APM  
Step-by-step runbook for responding to service deployment failures with validation and rollback procedures.

### 2. [Terraform Module: New Relic Alert Policy](./samples/02-terraform-module-readme.md)
**Demonstrates:** Infrastructure-as-Code, Terraform documentation, reusable modules  
Production-ready Terraform module for provisioning NRQL alert policies with examples and comprehensive documentation.

### 3. [SLO Design: Service Latency Thresholds](./samples/03-slo-design-latency.md)
**Demonstrates:** SRE principles, observability strategy, threshold justification  
Design document explaining p95 latency and error rate thresholds with NRQL queries and dashboard architecture.

### 4. [Post-Incident Summary: Deployment Rollback](./samples/04-post-incident-summary.md)
**Demonstrates:** Incident analysis, blameless postmortems, structured problem-solving  
Complete incident report with timeline, root cause analysis, and prevention measures.

## 🎯 Project Context

These samples are based on a DevSecOps pipeline implementation where I:

- ✅ Designed and implemented a DevSecOps pipeline integrating Kubernetes with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Built full CI/CD stages with SonarQube and Trivy security scanning
- ✅ Integrated New Relic APM, Kubernetes Monitoring, and distributed tracing
- ✅ Created NRQL alert policies for proactive incident detection
- ✅ **Result:** Reduced deployment errors by 30% and improved compliance coverage by 25%
